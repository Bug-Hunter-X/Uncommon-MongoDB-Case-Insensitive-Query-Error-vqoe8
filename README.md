This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using MongoDB queries with case-insensitive regular expressions. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, which uses a case-insensitive regular expression to search for names. This may lead to unexpected behavior, such as not finding names that differ only in capitalization. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to ensure correct results regardless of capitalization.
